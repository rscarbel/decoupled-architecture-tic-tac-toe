# Tic-Tac-Toe

[Play game](https://rscarbel.github.io/decoupled-architecture-tic-tac-toe/)

Even though this is just tic-tac-toe, I still made it moderately interesting with the features I implemented.

### This project is very modularized
* The code is agnostic to the size of the board
  * e.g. a 900 x 900 board would work just the same.
* The code ai is agnostic to the victory conditions
  * you could change the rules of the game, and the ai will still operate


I don't plan on adding to this project, but I also don't plan on removing it like many of my early projects.
Tic-tac-toe is almost as classic as fizz-buzz or hello world, so it has earned it's rightful place here.
